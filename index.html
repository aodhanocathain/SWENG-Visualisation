        <h><b>Visualization of Software Engineering Activity</b></h>
        <p>In my research for the Measuring Software Engineering Report I heard of issues surrounding metrics like Lines Of Code, where
        <br>counting some aspect of software doesn't indicate the quality of what is being counted, and is not an effective measure of productivity.
        <br>This inspired me to experiment with methods to assess commit quality, and to bias evaluation in favour of higher quality commits, such 
        <br>that their use in evaluating productivity is more effective. In many cases, the vast majority of contributions come from a small few developers,
        <br>and the rest of the names in the chart legend hardly have a visible impact in the chart.
        </p>
        <p>For this project, I focused on 3 aspects of commits, and assigned a score to each developer in a GitHub repository based on their commit history.
        <br>The contribution of each developer relative to each other is visualised using Chart.js
