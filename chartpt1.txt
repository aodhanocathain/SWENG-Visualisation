    <br>
    <p1>The below graph visualizes the value of each contributor to the repository.
    <br>
    Scores are calculated by taking the commit counts of each contributor, and weighting them according to their scale and their regularity.
    <br>
    Commit irregularity is penalised, and commits featuring many additions and/or deletions are ranked favourably.
    <br>
    This trio consisting of commit count, commit frequency and commit impact provides an estimation of software engineering productivity, which is used to assign
    <br>value to individual software engineers, and visualise it for this project.
    <br><br>
    I was inspired to combine 3 metrics by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323719116_Software_metrics_for_fault_prediction_using_machine_learning_approaches_A_literature_review_with_PROMISE_repository_dataset">this paper</a>
     which asserts in admittedly broken English that "three  combination  of  software  metrics  are  sufficient".
